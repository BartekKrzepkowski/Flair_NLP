    "> Nice in use<br>\n",
    "> Comes with quasi pre-trained models<br>\n",
    "> Includes flair embeddings, as also other powerful embeddings based on transformer architectures like ELMo or BERT<br>\n",
    "> Achieves SOTA results in NER and POS<br>\n",
    "> Flair embeddings deals with polysemy problem<br>\n",
    "> Character based model is less susceptible to misspellings, works well with prefixes and suffixes, and can handle OOV words<br>\n",
    "> Flairâ€™s interface allows us to combine different word embeddings<br>\n",
